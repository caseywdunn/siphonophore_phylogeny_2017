Notes on analyses - 

For the supermatrix, `agalma diagnostics hide` was used to remove two outgroup species that had low gene occupancy (based on reports) from the final supermatrix and phylogeny. These two species were Atolla_vanhoeffeni and Aegina_citrea. These species can be retrieved using `agalma diagnostics unhide`, however it should be noted that all subsequent analyses were carried out without these two species.

Alignment has 311681 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 49.68%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 user-specified trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

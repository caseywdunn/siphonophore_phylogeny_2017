Alignment has 328961 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 49.68%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 user-specified trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
